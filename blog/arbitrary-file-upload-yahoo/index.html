									<h3 class="major">Starting the Research</h3>
									<p>While doing a security research on Yahoo Inc. systems, I decided to analyze its iOS apps and see how they were handled. Yahoo in general has wide variety of scopes from all of its *.yahoo.com domain to domains of it acquisitions as well. That said, many researchers focus on web applications that Yahoo has which leaves some of its iOS apps vulnerable.</p>
									
									<p>First process was to download the app. To test out a security of one of its services, I downloaded Cabana. <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cabana-hang-out-watch-stuff/id1217648367?mt=8">Cabana</a> is an iOS app developed by Yahoo Inc. When first downloading it looks that this allows users to send pictures and share live videos with their friends.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Finding the vulnerability</h3>
									<p>After the app was downloaded, it requested that I signup on the website. Once the signup was done, it asked, me to upload a profile picture. While using the app, I used Burp Suite to intercept/monitor every request the app was making. When the picture was uploaded, it sent a <code>POST</code> request to cabana.yahoo.com and uploaded the jpeg image. Cabana mostly relies on image sharing, so I decided to play around with its upload function. It seemed that no matter what was in the POST request, it will by default set the filetype to <code>image/jpeg</code>. This was done through Content-Type header. I forwarded this request to the Repeater tab.</p>
									
									<p>In the repeater tab, I changed the Content-Type from <code>image/jpeg</code> to <code>text/html</code> and added a simple script:
									<pre><code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;alert(document.domain)&#x3C;/script&#x3E;</code></pre> When the request was forwarded, it gave me a link with .html extension on it. When the link was copied and browsed to, it loaded the HTML file and the javascript executed. </p>
									
									<p>Yahoo fixed this vulnerability on June 1, 2017</p>
